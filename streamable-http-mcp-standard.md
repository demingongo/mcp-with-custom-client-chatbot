# Streamable HTTP: The MCP Standard

In March 2025, the Model Context Protocol team made a significant decision: deprecate the SSE transport that had served MCP since its initial release and replace it with Streamable HTTP. This wasn't a minor version bump—it was a fundamental rethinking of how MCP clients and servers communicate.

If you've been following the AI tooling landscape, you know MCP is becoming the standard for connecting AI models to external capabilities. Understanding this transport evolution isn't just protocol trivia—it's essential knowledge for building production AI systems that interact with MCP servers.

This lesson explains why the change happened, how Streamable HTTP works, and how to implement clients that work with modern MCP infrastructure.

## Why MCP Deprecated SSE

Server-Sent Events worked for MCP's initial use case: streaming responses from server to client. But as MCP adoption grew, three limitations became critical:

### Limitation 1: SSE is Unidirectional

SSE was designed for one thing: pushing data from server to client. That's perfect for streaming AI responses, but MCP needs more. Modern MCP interactions involve:

-   Client sends tool request to server
-   Server might need to ask client for clarification
-   Client provides additional context
-   Server completes the operation

This back-and-forth requires bidirectional communication. With pure SSE, MCP had to maintain two separate endpoints:

```
Client ──POST─→ MCP Server (for requests)Client ←─SSE──  MCP Server (for responses/notifications)
```

Two endpoints means two connections, doubled complexity, and infrastructure that needs to handle both patterns.

### Limitation 2: Infrastructure Compatibility

Many corporate environments use HTTP proxies, load balancers, and firewalls that handle standard HTTP requests without issue but struggle with long-lived SSE connections:

Infrastructure

HTTP POST

SSE Stream

Standard proxies

Works

Often times out

Load balancers

Distributes normally

Session affinity issues

Firewalls

Usually allowed

May block long connections

CDNs

Caches appropriately

Cannot cache streams

When developers reported that their MCP servers worked in development but failed behind corporate infrastructure, the transport was often the culprit.

### Limitation 3: Complexity for Simple Use Cases

Not every MCP interaction needs streaming. A tool that looks up a database value and returns it doesn't benefit from a streaming connection—it just needs request/response. But with SSE, every interaction required establishing a stream, even for simple operations.

Streamable HTTP solves this by making streaming optional:

```
// Simple request/response - no streaming neededconst result = await fetch(mcpEndpoint, {  method: "POST",  body: JSON.stringify(request),});const data = await result.json();// Streaming when you need it - still uses the same endpointconst streamResult = await fetch(mcpEndpoint, {  method: "POST",  body: JSON.stringify(request),});for await (const chunk of parseSSE(streamResult.body!)) {  // Handle streamed data}
```

Same endpoint, same protocol, optional streaming. The server decides whether to stream based on the request.

## How Streamable HTTP Works

Streamable HTTP is elegantly simple: POST your JSON-RPC request to a single endpoint. The server responds with either:

1.  **A complete JSON response** (for quick operations)
2.  **An SSE stream** (for long-running or multi-message responses)

The client doesn't need to know in advance which will happen—it handles whatever comes back.

### The Request Pattern

Every MCP request follows JSON-RPC 2.0 format:

```
interface McpRequest {  jsonrpc: "2.0";  id: string;  method: string;  params?: unknown;}
```

You POST this to the MCP endpoint:

```
const response = await fetch(mcpEndpoint, {  method: "POST",  headers: {    "Content-Type": "application/json",  },  body: JSON.stringify({    jsonrpc: "2.0",    id: crypto.randomUUID(),    method: "tools/call",    params: {      name: "search_database",      arguments: { query: "customer records" },    },  }),});
```

### Session Management with Mcp-Session-Id

Stateful MCP operations require session continuity. The server assigns a session ID in its first response; the client includes it in subsequent requests:

```
// First request - no session yetconst firstResponse = await fetch(mcpEndpoint, {  method: "POST",  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },  body: JSON.stringify(initRequest),});// Server assigns session ID in response headerconst sessionId = firstResponse.headers.get("Mcp-Session-Id");// Subsequent requests include the session IDconst secondResponse = await fetch(mcpEndpoint, {  method: "POST",  headers: {    "Content-Type": "application/json",    "Mcp-Session-Id": sessionId!,  },  body: JSON.stringify(nextRequest),});
```

This pattern enables stateful conversations without the complexity of maintaining WebSocket connections.

## Implementing a Streamable HTTP Client

Here's a complete implementation that handles both simple responses and streamed responses:

```
interface McpResponse {  jsonrpc: "2.0";  id: string;  result?: unknown;  error?: { code: number; message: string };}class McpClient {  private endpoint: string;  private sessionId: string | null = null;  constructor(endpoint: string) {    this.endpoint = endpoint;  }  async request(method: string, params?: unknown): Promise<McpResponse> {    const headers: Record<string, string> = {      "Content-Type": "application/json",    };    // Include session ID if we have one    if (this.sessionId) {      headers["Mcp-Session-Id"] = this.sessionId;    }    const response = await fetch(this.endpoint, {      method: "POST",      headers,      body: JSON.stringify({        jsonrpc: "2.0",        id: crypto.randomUUID(),        method,        params,      }),    });    // Update session ID from response    const newSessionId = response.headers.get("Mcp-Session-Id");    if (newSessionId) {      this.sessionId = newSessionId;    }    // Check if response is SSE stream or regular JSON    const contentType = response.headers.get("Content-Type") ?? "";    if (contentType.includes("text/event-stream")) {      // Handle as SSE stream - collect final result      return await this.handleStreamedResponse(response);    } else {      // Handle as regular JSON response      return await response.json();    }  }  private async handleStreamedResponse(    response: Response  ): Promise<McpResponse> {    const reader = response.body!.getReader();    const decoder = new TextDecoder();    let buffer = "";    let finalResult: McpResponse | null = null;    while (true) {      const { done, value } = await reader.read();      if (done) break;      buffer += decoder.decode(value, { stream: true });      const lines = buffer.split("\n\n");      buffer = lines.pop() ?? "";      for (const line of lines) {        if (line.startsWith("data: ") && line !== "data: [DONE]") {          const data = JSON.parse(line.slice(6));          // Accumulate or process intermediate results          finalResult = data;        }      }    }    if (!finalResult) {      throw new Error("No result received from stream");    }    return finalResult;  }  async initialize(): Promise<void> {    const result = await this.request("initialize", {      protocolVersion: "2025-03-26",      capabilities: {},      clientInfo: {        name: "my-mcp-client",        version: "1.0.0",      },    });    if (result.error) {      throw new Error(`Initialize failed: ${result.error.message}`);    }  }  async callTool(name: string, args: unknown): Promise<unknown> {    const result = await this.request("tools/call", {      name,      arguments: args,    });    if (result.error) {      throw new Error(`Tool call failed: ${result.error.message}`);    }    return result.result;  }}
```

**Output (using the client):**

```
const client = new McpClient("https://mcp.example.com/v1");await client.initialize();const result = await client.callTool("search", { query: "TypeScript" });console.log(result);// { documents: [...], count: 42 }
```

## Backward Compatibility Detection

Not all MCP servers have upgraded to Streamable HTTP. When connecting to an unknown server, use this detection pattern:

```
async function detectTransport(  serverUrl: string): Promise<"streamable-http" | "sse"> {  try {    // Try Streamable HTTP first    const response = await fetch(serverUrl, {      method: "POST",      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },      body: JSON.stringify({        jsonrpc: "2.0",        id: "probe",        method: "initialize",        params: {          protocolVersion: "2025-03-26",          capabilities: {},          clientInfo: { name: "probe", version: "1.0" },        },      }),    });    if (response.ok) {      return "streamable-http";    }  } catch {    // POST failed, try SSE  }  // Fall back to SSE detection  return "sse";}
```

This follows the MCP specification recommendation: attempt POST first, fall back to SSE for servers using the older protocol version.

## When to Use Each Transport

**Use Streamable HTTP (current standard) when:**

-   Building new MCP clients or servers
-   Deploying behind corporate infrastructure
-   You need bidirectional communication
-   Simple operations don't require streaming

**Support SSE fallback when:**

-   Connecting to servers you don't control
-   Supporting legacy MCP server versions
-   Maximum compatibility is required

The MCP TypeScript SDK 1.10.0 (released April 17, 2025) was the first to support Streamable HTTP. If you're using an older SDK version, you'll need to upgrade.
